## Overview 
The goal of this course is introduce the statsitical underpinnings needed to solve a
many modern statistical problems.  Our focus will be on key ideas in prediction and decision 
making. Often we will try to find the simplest version of a problem/algorithm/idea 
that illustrates salient features while leaving more complex nuanced versions to 
homework or to self-study.  On a related note, this course is **not** a catalog 
of machine learning algorithms and all their variants; such a catalog would
immediately be out-of-date as new methods are constantly being introduced (furthemore, 
learning and using new methods becomes dramatically easier if one has strong intuitive and theoretical
understanding of the foundations of machine learning.)  While much of our lecture time will be
spent on proofs and derivations, the homework will involve putting these indeas into practice 
with simulation experiments or data anlyses.
